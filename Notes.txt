-Javascript Notes-

* JavaScript is the most-used language for client-side scripting on the Internet.
* JavaScript is an interpreted language, rather than a compiled language such as Java or C++.

* alert(); - will display the message as an alert on browser. For example alert("Hello World!"); .... Also can use the property of the title such as alert(document.title); - this will display the title of the document. 

* Another cool trick is to find the date and time that the web page was last changed using alert(document.lastModified); ---- It will output something like this 01/03/2019 00:30:43

* Keeping your javascript separate from your HTML as you can see on my Helloworld example I have placed javascript in mycode.js and then call it on my HTML section as <script src ='mycode.js'></script>

* HTML Comments - can be shown using <script> <!-- A comment --> </script> also seen on page 23.

* When trying to make a new line for javascript use "\n" ... unless you are rendering it for HTML then use <br><br/>
